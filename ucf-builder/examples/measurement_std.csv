normalization_instructions,"The following equation converts the median YFP fluorescence to RPU.  RPU = (YFP – YFP0)/(YFPRPU – YFP0), where YFP is the median fluorescence of the cells of interest, YFP0 is the median autofluorescence, and YFPRPU is the median fluorescence of the cells containing the measurement standard plasmid"
plasmid_description,"p15A plasmid backbone with kanamycin resistance and a YFP expression cassette. Upstream isulation by terminator L3S3P21
and a 5’-promoter spacer.  Promoter BBa_J23101, ribozyme RiboJ, RBS BBa_B0064 drives constitutive YFP expression, with transcriptional termination by L3S3P21."
